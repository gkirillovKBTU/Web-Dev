            <h5>Why do some forms change colors?</h5>
            <p>Colorful forms may occur throughout the year in various seasons. The mysterious appearance is due to the presence of unknown phenomena. Spectacular forms can be observed in both tropical and arctic regions.

        <p>In meteorology, a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also known as aerosols and are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.</p>

        <p>Terrestrial cloud formation is the result of air in Earth's atmosphere becoming saturated due to either or both of two processes: cooling of the air and adding water vapor. With sufficient saturation, precipitation will fall to the surface.</p>
